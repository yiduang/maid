\"一、安装同步带时，必须两轮的中心距可以移动，必须先将带轮的中心距缩短，装好同步带后，再使中心距复位。若有涨紧轮时，先把中心距放松，然后装上同步带，再装上涨紧轮。\",\r\n      \"二、往带轮上装同步带时，切记不要用力过猛，或用螺丝刀硬撬同步带，以防止同步带的抗拉层产生外观觉察不到折断现象。设计带轮时，最好选用两轴能互相移动的结构，若结构不允许时，则最好把同步带与带轮一起装到相应的轴上。\",\r\n      \"三、同步带安装时必须按不同的型号和带宽适当地加以涨紧力。\",\r\n      \"四、同步带传动中，两轮轮轴线的平行度要求比较高，否则同步带在工作时会产生跑偏，甚至跳出带轮，轴线不平行还将引起压力不均匀，使带齿早期磨损。\",\r\n      \"五、支撑带轮的机架，必须有足够的刚度，否则带轮在运转中就会造成两轴线不平行。\",\r\n      \"六、同步带运转时，严禁固体物质轧入齿槽，因为同步带抗拉层允许伸长极小，异物轧入时，同步带在不能伸长的情况下会被切断。\",\r\n      \"七、在起动时，中心距改变，皮带松弛，会发生跳齿现象，应检查带轮的机架是否松动，轴的定位是否失准。加以调整、加固。\",\r\n      \"八、涨紧轮一定要安装在带的背部一侧。\"\r\n    ],\r\n    FAQ:
